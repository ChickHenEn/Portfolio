# ChickHenEn's Portfolio.

Hello, Im ChickHenEn! Ive been scripting for almost five years, and I am a very ambitious scripter.

## Main Info
Hello I’m ChickHenEn! I have been scripting since 2018, and I am a very dedicated and motivated scripter! Scripting on the Roblox platform has been my passion for a while, and I've adapted to many different scripting styles and architectures and have gotten used to working with many different scripting environments.

I can guarantee to work efficiently and optimally with what I create. I take the stretch to be as organized as possible, as I believe that keeping a project organized helps with total development production and the changes of what I make. I work cooperatively in a team, and I can provide more then just scripting power to the table. I have some experience in building, UI design, game design, game formatting and more.


I Prefer to work with Knit and ProfileService, as they maximize code-efficiency and allow for better control of overall scripting patterns.
